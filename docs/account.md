## Your Nimbella cloud account

Your Nimbella cloud account gives you the following benefits:

- A dedicated and secure domain name for your cloud applications. If you need more, let us know.
- Static front-end assets are automatically deployed to and served from a global CDN.
- Back-ends you can run on demand, near-instantly. No servers for you to manage.
- A secured data bucket to upload files. Limit access as needed.
- Application state recorded in a [Redis key-value store](https://redis.io), with data accessible to all your back-end logic at extremely low latency.
- Workflows you can build and the ability to orchestrate long-running tasks.
- CLI and workbench tools to manage Nimbella services, build projects, and deploy your apps.

Once you [create your first Nimbella Cloud namespace](namespaces.md#create-a-nimbella-namespace) you are ready to login and [run CLI commands](commands.md#nim-command-overview) and deploy projects to your Nimbella Cloud.
