## Adding static web content

To add static web content to a project, add a directory called _web_ as a peer of the directory called _packages_. This directory should contain files whose suffixes imply well-known mime types for web content, such as _.html_, _.css_, or _.js_.

**Note:** JavaScript files in static web content are _not_ actions but are scripts intended to run in the browser.

The _web_ directory can have subdirectories and can be built by website builders or other tools.

Like an action directory, the _web_ directory may contain `.include` or `.ignore` to control what is actually considered web content, as opposed to build support or intermediate results. For more information about `.include` and `.ignore`, see [Multifile actions created with autozip](actions.md#multifile-actions-created-with-autozip).

The _web_ directory also supports integrated [building](building.md), just like an action directory.

Here’s an example of a project with modest web content, populated by hand. For simplicity, the actions of the project are not shown.

```js
example3/web/chatroom.html
example3/web/chatroom.css
example3/web/runner.js
example3/web/favicon.ico
```

Here’s a diagram of the `example3` project structure.

Here’s the output when the project is deployed.

```shell
> nim project deploy example3
Deploying project '/path/to/example3'
  to namespace '...'
  on host 'https://...nimbella.io'

Deployed 4 web content items to
  https://<namespace>-host.nimbella.io
Deployed actions:
  ...
```

As the output shows, the contents of the web directory were deployed to the web, with URLs within your namespace’s unique DNS domain `<namespace>-host.nimbella.io`, where `<namespace>` is your namespace. The remaining portion of the domain name may differ depending your account configuration and your API host within the Nimbella Cloud. To access the content, either `http` or `https` may be used. For `https`, the SSL certificate will be that of Nimbella Corp.

**Notes:**

*   For a web deployment to work correctly, the namespace entry in the credential store must include storage. See [View the Credential Store](namespaces.md#view-the-credential-store) to generate the credential store, then check to make sure the `Storage` column of the response says `yes`. The first namespace created for each user includes storage, but it’s possible to create namespaces without it.
*   You can add [project configuration to change how your static web content is deployed](configuration.md#project-configuration-for-web-content).
See [an example of how to configure a project when you generate web content with a tool such as React.](configuration.md#configuration-example-for-web-content-generated-by-a-tool)
